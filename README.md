# Setting up the CRUD REST API
Single Resource CRUD REST API. 

This project uses Django 3.2 LTS and been written with Python 3.9.
We use Pipenv for package management and virtualization.

# Installation
## Install Pipenv
We use pipenv to manage our Python packages and virtualenv all in one.

```shell
% pip install pipenv
```

## Install Django Framework and Dependencies using Pipenv
Install Django Framework, dependencies, and dev packages

We use [HTTPIE](https://httpie.io/) over curl commands to run CRUD operations from the CLI. Promise it's much better!

```shell
% pipenv install --dev
```

Enter into the Virtualenv and check that the packages have installed correctly. 
Below is an example of the packages that installed

```shell
% pipenv shell 
% pip list

# Accessing the API EndPoints

The following endpoints have been exposed:

    * /widgets/             # List View
    * /widgets/:id>/        # Detailed View via the id

## Accessing Endpoints from the CLI

Use `http` to access the endpoints. Some examples are provided below:

Make sure you are in the root directory of the repo and in the venv

```shell
% pipenv shell
% http GET http://localhost:8000/widgets/
% http PUT http://localhost:8000/widgets/1/ name="Weather" parts=3
% http DELETE http://localhost:8000/widgets/3/
```
## Accessing Endpoints from the Browser

Thanks to Django Framework a browsable API is available for the Widget

`List View`

http://localhost:8000/widgets/

`Detailed View`

http://localhost:8000/widgets/1/
# OpenAPI Spec

Once the server is running, you can check out the OpenAPI spec by visiting:

http://localhost:8000/docs

# Testing

There currently exists 1 Unit Test for the model itself and 4 Functional Tests for each CRUD operation. 

## Locate the tests in the Repository 
Tests can be located in `widget_project->widget->test.py`

## Running the tests

```shell
% pipenv shell
% cd widget_project
% python manage.py test
